# AMBERFromScratch
An attempt to build a computational chemistry library from (basically) scratch. 
Goals:
- Predict the lowest energy 3D structure of a molecule from just an ".xyz" file of atom positions.
- Generate atom and bond features from molecule for use in GNNs
(current code is relatively old and is in the process of being revamped)
